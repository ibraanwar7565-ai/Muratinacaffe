## 📲 Install as an app (PWA)

Muratina POS is a Progressive Web App, so it can be installed like a native app:

- **Desktop (Chrome/Edge):** open the site, then click the **Install** button
  (bottom-right) or the install icon in the address bar.
- **Android (Chrome):** menu → *Install app* / *Add to Home screen*.
- **iOS (Safari):** Share → *Add to Home Screen*.

It launches in its own window (no browser chrome), keeps a cached app shell, and
shows a friendly offline page when there's no connection. Installability needs
`https://` **or** `http://localhost` (Laragon's localhost works out of the box).

---

## 🚀 Setup (Laragon)

1. **Copy the project** into Laragon's web root:
   ```
   C:\laragon\www\Muratinacaffe
   ```

2. **Start** Apache & MySQL from the Laragon control panel.

3. **Create the database.** Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` (or Laragon's
   *Database* tool) and import:
   ```
   database/schema.sql
   ```
   This creates the `muratina_pos` database with tables, demo products,
   categories, suppliers, customers and three demo users.

4. **Check the DB credentials** in `config/config.php`. Laragon defaults
   (`root` / empty password / `127.0.0.1`) work out of the box. You can also
   override via environment variables `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`.

5. **Open the app:**
   ```
   http://localhost/Muratinacaffe/
   ```

> Running without Laragon? From the project folder:
> `php -S localhost:8000` then visit `http://localhost:8000` — just make sure a
> MySQL server is reachable with the credentials in `config/config.php`.

## 🔑 Demo Accounts

Staff accounts use the password **`Pass@123`**. Waiters sign in on the **Waiter**
tab with their PIN.

| Login | Role | How to sign in | Access |
|-------|------|----------------|--------|
| `admin` | Manager | password `Pass@123` **or** PIN `194825` | Everything |
| `cashier` | Cashier | password `Pass@123` | POS, own sales, receipts, customers |
| `inventory` | Inventory Officer | password `Pass@123` | Products, stock, suppliers |
| Brian Waiter | Waiter | **PIN `1234`** | POS, own sales, receipts, customers |
| Aisha Waiter | Waiter | **PIN `5678`** | POS, own sales, receipts, customers |

> Already imported the old schema? Run `database/migration_waiter.sql` to add the
> waiter role and PIN column. Change these passwords/PINs before going live.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Passwords are stored with `password_hash()` (bcrypt) — never in plain text.
- Every state-changing request is protected by a per-session **CSRF token**.
- All queries use **PDO prepared statements** (no string-concatenated SQL).
- Sessions idle-timeout after 30 minutes (configurable in `config.php`).
- Sale processing runs inside a transaction with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` to
  prevent overselling under concurrent checkouts.

## 🛣️ Roadmap / Bonus ideas

Barcode scanner support (search box already accepts scanner input), live M-Pesa
STK push, QR-code payments, multi-branch, employee attendance, and sales
forecasting are natural next steps on top of this foundation.

Made with ☕ for modern cafés, restaurants and juice bars.
